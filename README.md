# brihuaa.github.io

## Description

This is a personal website project hosted on GitHub Pages. It includes custom
styles, animations, and dynamic content generation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/brihuaa/brihuaa.github.io.git
   ```
2. Open the project in your preferred code editor.
3. Serve the project locally using a live server or open `index.html` directly
   in your browser.

## Improvements

- **Dynamic Content Generation**: The project previously used `document.write`
  for generating dynamic content. This is being replaced with modern DOM
  manipulation methods like `innerHTML` and `createElement` for better
  maintainability and compatibility.

## Usage

- Open the website in a browser to view the content.
- Modify the styles in the `styles` folder or scripts in the `scripts` folder to
  customize the website.
